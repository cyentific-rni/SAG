## Summary
This repository provides an elevated [STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html) representation of the [MITRE ATT&CK Groups knowledge base v11.1](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/), structurally extending the one provided in the [Official MITRE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/master/enterprise-attack/intrusion-set).

The version/commit that has been used for this project is [1c96a78cb5d7fc53ab18d0cd3686e8f690115943](https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/1c96a78cb5d7fc53ab18d0cd3686e8f690115943/enterprise-attack/intrusion-set).

In particular, this project aimed to make the existing information in the ATT&CK Groups knowledge base programmatically more accessible, allowing it to more easily being queried upon and correlated with other sources and knowledge bases. The information used to extend and enrich the ATT&CK Groups STIX representation has been derived from the available prose descriptions.

---

**This repository includes:**

* STIX relationship objects and domain objects indicating the location (country) the groups/intrusion-sets appear to originate from.

`
sdo:intrusion-set -> sro:originates-from -> sdo:location
`

* STIX relationship objects and domain objects indicating the locations (countries and regions) the groups/intrusion-sets have been observed targeting.

`
sdo:intrusion-set -> sro:targets -> sdo:location
`

* STIX relationship objects and domain objects indicating the sectors (industries) the groups/intrusion-sets have been observed targeting (using the `sectors` property in the `identity` object).

`
sdo:intrusion-set -> sro:targets -> sdo:identity
`

* new `intrusion-set` objects that additionally represent the motivation factor of a group (using the `primary_motivation` property in the `intrusion-set` object).

`
sdo:intrusion-set
`

---


The new enriched intrusion-set (group) objects with the `primary_motivation` property populated relate to the existing MITRE-created `intrusion-set` objects via the `derived-from` relationship object.

The entity that created a STIX Object is an inherent, factual part of that object and therefore that information is captured in an embedded relationship contained in the `created_by_ref` property.

## How do i operationalize this work and access the ATT&CK STIX representation?

The STIX objects available in this repository **complement** the ones found in the [Official MITRE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/eb1b9385d44340ce867a77358c5f5aaed666e54c/enterprise-attack); thus, the objects from both repositories should be utilized/imported.

In addition, to avoid duplicating objects, we utilized the [STIX location objects](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects/tree/main/objects/location) from the OASIS CTI TC [common objects repository](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects) to connect the intrusion sets/ATT&CK Groups with their possible origin and targeted countries/regions, and thus, those objects should be utilized/imported too. The location objects have been populated based on the ISO 3166-1 and the United Nations M49 standards.

**Overall to make use of this project, the following objects need to be utilized/imported:**

1. The STIX Objects available in the folders [intrusion-set](https://github.com/fovea-research/SAG/tree/main/intrusion-set), [relationship](https://github.com/fovea-research/SAG/tree/main/relationship), [identity](https://github.com/fovea-research/SAG/tree/main/identity), and [location](https://github.com/fovea-research/SAG/tree/main/location) of this repository (required), **or the [enterprise-attack-enrich.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fovea-research/SAG/main/enterprise-attack-enrich.json) file that unifies all the objects together**.
2. The MITRE-generated STIX Objects available in the folder [intrusion-set](https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/master/enterprise-attack/intrusion-set) (required) within the [enterprise-attack](https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/master/enterprise-attack) folder in GitHub, and optionally the rest of the object folders, **or the MITRE-generated [enterprise-attack.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre/cti/master/enterprise-attack/enterprise-attack.json) file that unifies all the objects together**.
3. The STIX Objects available in the folders [location](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix-common-objects/tree/main/objects/location) of the OASIS CTI TC (required), **or our generated [oasis-cti-stix-common-objects-location.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fovea-research/SAG/main/oasis-cti-stix-common-object-location.json) file that unifies all the objects together**.

The ATT&CK STIX representation is most easily manipulated in Python using the stix2 library. However, because STIX 2.1 is represented in JSON, other programming languages can easily interact with the raw content [3]. Also, dedicated efforts that work with STIX can be used (e.g., the OpenCTI platform).

### The lists/taxonomies that have been used to enrich the STIX representation of ATT&CK Groups and can be used to perform queries and conduct analysis are:

* Countries based on ISO 3166-1:
  * ALPHA-2 Codes. Can be queried using the `country` property of the `location` object.
  * Country names. Can be queried using the `name` property of the `location` object.


* Geographic regions based on the United Nations M49 Standard and two additional, namely, `middle-east` and `south-china-sea`:
  *  Can be queried using the `region` property of the `location` object. The region list can be found also in the [STIX Specification Version 2.1 Committee Specification 02 - Region Vocabulary](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs02/stix-v2.1-cs02.html#_i1sw27qw1v0s).

* Motivations as presented in the [STIX Specification Version 2.1 Committee Specification 02 - Attack Motivation Vocabulary](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs02/stix-v2.1-cs02.html#_dmb1khqsn650).

* A sector/industry taxonomy as presented right below. **Note that the sector/industry taxonomy for cyber threat intelligence is a work in progress from the [OASIS Threat Actor Context Technical Committee (TAC)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tac)**. The specification perse will be referenced when it will reach the Committee Specification status/level from OASIS.
